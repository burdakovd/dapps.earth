# dapps.earth

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/burdakovd/dapps.earth.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/burdakovd/dapps.earth)

Source code for dapps.earth: ipfs and swarm/ENS gateway

Distinctive feature is that it separates different ipfs hashes into individual domains, so they can't mess with each other.
